bla bla bla bla [id Software](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software) for [MS-DOS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS).

<!-- excerpt -->
Along with its predecessor [_Wolfenstein 3D_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), _Doom_ helped define the FPS genre and inspired numerous similar games, known as "[_Doom_ clones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_clone)". It is one of the most significant games in [video game history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_history), and is frequently cited as one of the [greatest games of all time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_video_games_of_all_time). It pioneered [online distribution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_distribution) and technologies including [3D graphics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics), networked [multiplayer gaming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game), and support for customized [modifications](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modification_(video_game)) via packaged files ([WADs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_WAD)). Its graphic violence and hellish imagery also made it the [subject of controversy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_controversy), however.

_Doom_ has been [ported to numerous platforms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_versions_of_Doom). The [_Doom_ franchise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise)) continued with [_Doom II: Hell on Earth_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_II:_Hell_on_Earth) (1994) and [expansion packs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack) including [_Master Levels for Doom II_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Levels_for_Doom_II) (1995). The [source code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) was released in 1997, inspiring further adaptations. Id returned to the franchise with [_Doom 3_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_3) (2004), a horror-focused retelling using the [id Tech 4](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4) engine, followed by a 2005 [_Doom_ film](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(film)). A 2016 reboot also titled [_Doom_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(2016_video_game))_,_ powered by [id Tech 6](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_6), returned to the fast-paced action of the first games.
